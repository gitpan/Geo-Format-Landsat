Read one Vgroup record from the FILE, specified by name or filehandle.

Returned is a pair: the name of the record (for instance, C<L1_METADATA_FILE>)
and the destructed content.  Each nested group is represented by a nested
HASH.

The HASHes contain keys in capitals, which are exactly the fields as
found in the meta-data file.  Additionally, a number of lower-cased
keys are added (the lower cased versions of some upper-cased names)
with smart processed information.
